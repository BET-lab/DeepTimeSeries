DeepTimeSeries
============================================

Deep learning library for time series forecasting based on PyTorch.

.. Note::
   It is under development and the first released version will be announced
   soon.

Why DeepTimeSeries?
-------------------
DeepTimeSeries is inspired by libraries such as ``Darts`` and
``Pythorch Forecasting``. So why was DeepTimeSeries developed?

The design philosophy of DeepTimeSeries is as follows:

**We present logical guidelines for designing various deep learning models for
time series forecasting**

Our main target users are intermediate-level users who need to develop
deep learning models for time series prediction. We present solutions to the
problems that these users encounter due to the uniqueness of time series data.

We additionally implement a high-level API, which allows comparatively beginners
to use models that have already been implemented.
